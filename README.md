This repository is created during studying for Terraform:

Day 1:

IAC:
    Infrastructure as Code.
        Imperative: 
        Declarative:

    IAC Tools:
        - Terraform
        - Pulumi
        - Cloud formation template.
        - Azure Resource Manager.
        - Ansible.
        - Puppet.

Terraform:
    Build by Hashi Copr and is HCL which follows a JSON like syntax.
    Example:
    - JSON notation example
        {
            "name": "amit"
            "subjects": ["Maths", "English", "Hindi"]

                "city": "pune"

            }


        }

    - Hashicorp Configuration Language(HCL):
        {
            name= "Amit"
            subjects= [
                "Maths",

                city= "pune" 


            }

        }

            - Responsible for API calls,
            - Different providers have different pluging , For example AWS , Azure, K8s terraform plugin.
        ]


    }

        - It is a program/software that sends and recieves info/data back and forth between applications/webs/users.

                #token = $(az account get-access-token | jq -r ".accesstoken")
                    # Here jq -r is for json querry in raw format.
                #subscription_id = $(az account show| jq -r ".id")

                # In below command we will send out an querry to get an resource group name from the azure subscription, This is how we can call an API from shell.

                # curl -s -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" https://mgmt.azure.com/subscription/${subscription_id}/resourcegroup/?api.verision2021-0-4-01/
            ]
        curl_command_options:
            [

            ]
